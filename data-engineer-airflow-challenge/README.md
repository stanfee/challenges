## Additional Setup
In order to get the DAG to run, fill out the following Airflow variables with your own credentials on the Airflow webserver:
- NEWS_API_KEY
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- S3_BUCKET

## Additional Notes
Obviously there are lots of room for validation and additional testing. Given the 4-hours of allotted time I feel pretty confident with this solution. I am going to leave any next steps vague so we have plenty to talk about in the next round.
